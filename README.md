# Test Automation with Selenium in Java
While familiarizing myself with some automation tools, I've come across some
good practices and common classes/methods I like to use. I'm using my own gmail
account as an app to test, so you'll need a valid gmail account to run these as
they're written but the concepts can be used anywhere. Take them and use them if
you want, I'm just keeping them for myself but am open to your suggestions and
other tips and tricks.

I've used Maven to handle all the dependencies used so if you prfer not to do so,
make sure to have the dependencies listed in the pom.xml on your PATH somewhere.
